                        <p class="project-text">This project aims to demonstrate a deep understanding of design methods and principles by creating a final design intervention. I'll showcase a high-fidelity design solution that highlights clear decisions based on well-defined problem statements and proposed solutions. The final concept will be of finished quality, effectively conveying the core aspects of the design and presenting a coherent solution. The presentation will also include concise justifications for the design solution, supported by user research and design methods. Additionally, I'll show how the design concept was developed through thoughtful and reasonable design decisions, emphasizing a comprehensive and critical reflection on the design process.</p>
