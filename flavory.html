          <b>1. Building Cultural Trust</b><br>
          <b>Users were unsure which restaurants offered truly authentic experiences. Traditional star ratings felt vague or misleading.</b><br>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> We introduced community-verified reviews, expert-endorsed highlights, and storytelling through restaurant pages.

        <p class="ins-text social">
          <b>2. Activating Social Engagement</b><br>
          <b>Food discovery often felt passive. Users wanted more than browsing — they wanted to interact, share, and be rewarded.</b><br>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> We added fun food challenges, social feeds from friends, and community-based recommendations to boost participation.

        <p class="ins-text simple">
          <b>3. Keeping Exploration Simple</b><br>
          <b>While users liked personalization and cultural content, they didn’t want to feel overwhelmed by filters or dense info.</b><br>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> We streamlined the search flow with intuitive filters (taste, dish, country), short stories, and visual-first layouts.
