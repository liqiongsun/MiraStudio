          The purpose of this project is to help students learn the fundamental
          theories and practical skills of user experience design, and to apply
          this knowledge to improve the user experience of products and
          services. Through project-based learning, students will acquire the
          ability to collect user requirements and feedback, analyze user
          behaviors and preferences, design user-friendly interfaces and
          interactions, and evaluate and optimize the user experience of
